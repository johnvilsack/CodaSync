# CodaSync

CodaSync is a little Applescript tool I conjured up to make my life easier when it comes to keeping my copy of TextMate, Coda, and a few other programs the same between my machines. 

The program is fairly unintelligent, but it work for basic needs.

# What CodaSync Does

Create a new file in your ~/Dropbox/ folder called .CodaSync (hidden from normal Finder view)
Copy your Preferences, Themes, Bundles, etc. from the computer to your Dropbox
Download those same Preferences, Themes, Bundles, etc. from the Dropbox to your local machine

# What CodaSync Cannot Do

CodaSync only works if you have Dropbox installed in its default ~/Dropbox/ location
CodaSync does not copy the Coda.app file.
